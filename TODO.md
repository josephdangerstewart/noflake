Things to do:

- [ ] Make initial UI (see test results)
  - [ ] Create project flow
  - [ ] Test history page (most important)
  - [ ] How to allow custom auth strategies in UI?
- [ ] Add project metadata (e.g. github repo)
- [ ] Add suite context (e.g. PR build, master build, local, unknown)
- [ ] Figure out how to test playwright reporter
  - [ ] Maybe add playwright tests for UI and use no flake reporter?
- [ ] Add flake detection
- [ ] Add unit tests for permission utilities in node api
